    "\n",
    "MongoDB is a cross-platform, document oriented database that provides high performance, high availability and easy scalability. MongoDB works on concept of collection and document.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Database</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Database is a physical container for collections. Each database gets its own set of files on the file system. A single MongoDB server typically has multiple database.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Collection</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Collection is a group of MongoDB documents. It is equivalent of an RDBMS table. A collection exists within a single database. Collections do not enforce a schema. Documents within a collection can have differenet fields. Typically, all documents in a collection are of similar or related purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Document</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "A document is a set of a key-value pairs. Documents have dynamic schema. Dynamic schema means that documents in the same collection do not need to have the same set of fields or structure, and common fields in a collection's documents may hold different types of data."

    "        A query that does not use an index can be identified by its BasicCursor type. Such a query must scan every document in the collection. Hence, the number of scanned documents will always be equal to the collection's count, which makes the query slow for big collections.\n",
    "        A query that uses an index has a cursor of type BtreeCursor( or GeoBrowse-XYZ for a 2D index). The used index is part of the cursor type(_id_ in the case). MongoDB decides which query plan to use by occasionally executing them all, and using the first one to finish. You can see all plans for a query by passing true to explain.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing this assignment I could clearly see some of the advantages of MongoDB over any relational database. The structure of a single object is very clear(all fields of the objects are stored in the object itself), no more complex joins. All objects are automatically assigned with an unique index.It is a rich data structure capable of holding arrays and other documents. This means you can often represent in a single entity a construct that would require several tables to properly represent in a relational database. \n",
    "Since MongoDB is schema-free, our code defines our schema. Which helps the database to be more scalable."
